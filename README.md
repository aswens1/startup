# Specification Deliverable

## Elevator Pitch
Stuck in a reading block? No one wants to hear you talk about the book you just finished? Join a virtual book club with like minded people. Get book recommendations, ratings, create clubs with your friends, or join a public one! Share your thoughts and discuss ideas! Suggest books to be read next! Browse the community library for inspiration!

## Design
All design features are subject to change.
