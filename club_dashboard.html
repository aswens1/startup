                    Harry Potter has never played a sport while flying on broomstick. He's never worn a cloak of invisibility, befriended a giant,
                    or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable
                    son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in eleven years.
                    <br>
                    But all of that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful
                    place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great
                    destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.
