# Using Git and GitHub
So far I have learned some syntax and common commands to use while using Git in my command line.

to start working on an area
- clone -> clones a repository to a new directory
- init -> create an empty repository using git

work on the current change
- add -> add file contents to the index
- mv -> move or rename a file, directory, or a symlink
- restore -> restore working tree files
- rm -> remove fules from the working tree and from the index

examine history and state
- bisect -> use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
- diff -> show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
- grep -> print lines matching a pattern
- log -> show commit logs
- show -> show various types of objects
- status -> show the working tree status

grow, mark, and tweak your common history
- branch -> list, create, or delete branches
- commit -> record changes to the repository
- merge -> join two or more development histories together
- rebase -> reapply commits on top of another base tip
- reset -> reset current HEAD to the specified state
- switch -> switch branches
- tag -> create, list, delete, or verify a tag obkect signed with GPG

collaborate
- fetch -> download obkects and refs from another repository
- pull -> fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
- push -> update remote refs along with associated objects

# startup application
